# Information-gathering tool
Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating an information-gathering GUI tool using Python and PyQt5. This example will include functionality for simple information gathering tasks like performing WHOIS lookups, pinging hosts, and fetching public IP addresses.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Install Required Tools
Make sure you have Python and PyQt5 installed. Since you already have PyQt5 installed, you might need additional libraries for specific functionalities.

If you haven’t done so already, activate your virtual environment and install required libraries:


pip install pyqt5 requests
Set Up Your Project Directory

Create a directory for your project:


mkdir info_gathering_tool
cd info_gathering_tool

2. Create the Python Script
Create a file named info_tool.py:


nano info_tool.py
then add the give code and save it 

python info_tool.py
run this command to see your tool.
